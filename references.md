He had left her in her chambers, bent over a gaming table opposite Prince Trystane, pushing ornate pieces across squares of jade and carnelian and lapis lazuli. Myrcella's full lips has been slightly parted, her green eyes narrowed with concentration. *Cyvasse*, the game was called. It had come to the Planky Town on a trading galley from Volantis, and the orphans had spread it up and down the Greenblood. The dornish court was mad for it.

Ser Arys just found it maddening. There were ten different pieces, each with its own attributes and powers, and the board would change from game to game, depending on how the players arrayed their home squares. Prince Trystane had taken to the game at once, and Myrcella had learned it so she could play with him. She was not quite one-and-ten, her betrothed three-and-ten; even so, she had been winning more oft than not of late.

"I understand you've fought some mighty battles too, Your Grace," said Drey in his most cheerful voice. "It is said you show our brave Prince Trystane no mercy at the *cyvasse* table."

"He always sets his squares up the same way, with all the mountains in the front and his elephants in the passes," said Myrcella. "So I send my dragon through to eat his elephants."

"Does your handmaid play the game as well?" asked Drey.

"Rosamund?" asked Myrcella. "No, I tried to teach her, but she said the rules were too hard".

In one corner stood an ornate *cyvasse* table with pieces carved of ivory and onyx, though she had no one to play with even if she had been so inclined.

...

She sat beside the *cyvasse* table and idly moved an elephant.

Instead he delivered her to the prince's solar, where they found Doran Martell seated behind a *cyvasse* table, his gouty legs supported by a cushioned footstool. He was toying with an onyx elephant, turning it in his reddened, swollen hands.

...

"I told them to place a *cyvasse* table in your chambers," her father said when the two of them were alone.

"Who was I suppose to play with?" *Why is he talking about a game? Has the gout robbed him of his wits?*

"Yourself. Sometimes it is best to study a game before you attempt to play it. How well do you know the game, Arianne?"

"Well enough to play."

"But not to win. My brother loved the fight for its own sake, but I only play such games as I can win. *Cyvasse* is not for me."

...

She touched one of the *cyvasse* pieces, the heavy horse.

...

Still, this was no harmless game of *cyvasse*.

...

Her father plucked up a *cyvasse* piece. "I must know how you learned that Quentyn was abroad. Your brother went with Cletus Yronwood, Master Kedry, and three of Lord Yronwood's best young knights on a long and perilous voyage, with an uncertain welcome at its end. He has gone to bring us back out hearts desire."

She narrowed her eyes. "What is our hearts desire?"

"Vengeance." His voice was soft, as if he were afraid that someone might be listening. "Justice." Prince Doran pressed the onyx dragon into her palm with his swollen, gouty fingers, and whispered, *"Fire and blood."*

Number: 1

"Fancy another game of *cyvasse*?" The Halfmaester always defeated him, but it was a way to pass the time

...

"Try to give me a better battle this time, Yollo." You play *cyvasse* as badly as you tumble.

"I am trying to lull you into a false sense of confidence," said Tyrion, as they arranged their tiles on either side of the a carved wooden screen.

...

Haldon removed the screen. Each of them contemplated the other's opening array. "You are learning," the Halfmaester said.

Tyrion almost grabbed his dragon but thought better of it. Last game he had brought her out too soon and lost her to a trebuchet. "If we do meet those fabled pirates, I may join up with them. I'll tell them my name is Hugor Halfmaester." He moved his light horse toward Haldon's mountains.

Haldon answered with an elephant. "Hugo Halfwit would suit you better."

"I only need half my wits to be a match for you." Tyrion moved up his heavy horse to support the light. "Perhaps you care to wager on the outcome?"

The Halfmaester arched an eyebrow. "How much?"

"I have no coin. We'll play for secrets."

"Griff would cut my tounge out."

"Afraid, are you? I would be if I were you."

"The day you defeat me at *cyvasse* will be the day turtles crawl out my arse." The Halfmaester moved his spears. "You have your wager, little man."

Tyrion stretched a hand out for his dragon.

It was three hours later when the little man finally crept back up on deck to empty his bladder.

"Prince Aegon," said Tyrion, "since we're both stuch aboard this boat, perhaps you will honor me with a a game of *cyvasse* to while away the hours?"

The prince game him a wary look. "I am sick of *cyvasee*."

"Sick of losing to a dwarf, you mean?"

That pricked the lad's pride, just as Tyrion had known it would. "Go fetch the board and pieces. This time I mean to smash you."

They played on deck, sitting cross-legged behind the cabin. Young Griff arrayed his army for attack with dragon, elephants, and heavy horse up front. *A young mans formation, as bold as it is foolish. He risks it all for the quick kill.* He let the prince have first move. Haldon stood behind them, watching the play.

When the prince reached for his dragon, Tyrion cleared his throat. "I would not do that if I were you. It is a mistake to bring your dragon out too soon." He smiled innocently. "Your father knew the dangers of being overbold."

...

Tyrion moved his elephants.

...

He picked up his heavy horse and put it down with a thump.

...

Tyrion moved his crossbows

...

The dwarf pushed his black dragon across a range of mountains

...

Smiling, he seized his dragon, flew it across the board. "I hope Your Grace will pardon me. Your king is trapped. Death in four."

The prince stared at the playing board. "My dragon-"

"-is too far away to save you. You should have moved her to the center of the battle."

"But you said-"

"I lied. *Trust no one.* And keep your dragon close."

Young Griff jerked to his feet and kicked over the board. *Cyvasse* pieces flew in all directions, bouncing and rolling across the deck of Shy Maid.

Description: Qavo and Tyrion playing
Number: 2

In the alcove two men sat over a carved stone cyvasse table, squinting at their pieces by the light of a red candle.

...

Neither looked up from their game until Haldon drew up a chair between them and said, "My dwarf plays better *cyvasse* than both of you combined."

...

"Is he for sale?" he asked in the Common Tounge of Westeros. "The triarch's grotesquerie is in need to a *cyvasse*-playing dwarf."

"Yollo is no slave"

"What a pity." The thin man shifted an onyx elephant.

The man behind the alabaster army pursed his lips in disapproval. He moved his heavy horse.

"A blunder," said Tyrion. He had as well play his part.

"Just so," the thin man said. He answered with his own heavy horse. A flurry of quick moves followed, until finally the thin man smiled and said, "Death, my friend."

...

Haldon said, "The noble Qavo Nogarys is the customs officer here in Selhorys. I have never once defeated him at *cyvasse*."

...

As each of them was setting up their pieces behind the *cyvasse* screen, Haldon said, "What news from downriver? Will it be war?"

...

Qavo removed the screen and studied the placement of Tyrion's army.

...

Tyrion advanced his spearman. Qavo replied with his light horse. Tyrion moved his crossbowman up a square and said, "The red priest outside seemed to think Volantis should fight for this silver queen, not against her."

...

"What rantings?" the dwarf asked, toying with his rabble.

...

"Very good," he said, plucking up his dragon. "The most powerful piece in the game," he announced, as he removed one of Qavo's elephants.

...

He moved his catapult again, closed his hand around Tyron's alabaster dragon, removed it from the board.

The rest was slaughter. Though the dwarf held on another dozen moves.

Chapter: 47, Tyrion X
Description: Plumm and Tyrion playing
Number: 2

Then a lord in a blue *tokar* fringed with tiger's eyes recalled that Tyrion had boasted of his skill at *cyvasse* on the auction block. "Let us put him to the test," he said. A table and set of pieces were duly produced. A scant few moments later, the red-faced lord shoved the table over in fury, scattering pieces across the carpets to the sounds on Yunkish laughter.

"You should have let him win,  Penny whispered.

Brown Ben Plumm lifted the fallen table, smiling. "Try me next dwarf. When I was younger, the Second Sons took contract with Volantis. I learned the game there."

...

The scattered pieces were picked up off the carpet, and they sat down to play.

Tyrion won the first game. Plumm took the second, for double the stakes. As they set up for their third contest, the dwarf studied his opponent.

...

The sellsword was nearly as bad a player as the Yunkish lord had been, but his play was solid and tenacious rather than bold. His opening arrays were different every time, yet the same - conservative, defensive, passive. *He does not play not win,* Tyrion realized. *He plays so as not to lose.* It worked in the second game, when the little man overreached himself with an unsound assault. It did not work in the third game, nor the fourth, nor the fifth, which proved to be their last.

Near the end of the final contest, with his fortress is ruins, his dragon dead, elephants before him and heavy horse circling round his rear, Plumm looked up smiling and said, "Yollo wins again. Death in four"

"Three." Tyrion tapped his dragon. "I was lucky. Perhaps you should give my head a good rub before our next game, Captain. Some of that luck might rub off on your fingers." *You will still lose, but you might give me a better game.* Grinning he pushed back from the *cyvasse* table, picked up his wine flagon, and returned to pouring with Yezzan zo Qaggaz considerably richer and Brown Ben Plumm considerably impoverished.
